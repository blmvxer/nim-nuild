# Nuild Simple Build Config
<b>Nuild Ideas</b><br>
The main goal of nuild is to provide a simple, elegant, and<br>
streamlined make system with a easy-to-read configuration<br>
<b>Initial install</b>
simply execute<br>
 $nim c nuild.nim<br>
 $./nuild<br><br>
This will install nuild to your /usr/bin folder<br><br>
<b>Configuration files</b><br>
A config file must be named build.conf and have the following contents<br><br>
build=mynimfile.nim<br><br>
any other configuration can be added by looking at the build.config for nuild<br><br>
<b>WIP</b><br>
Not all the arguments for the compiler have been implemented as of this time
